#
#       PDX blockchain hypercloud sandbox for smart-contract applications
#
#       On PDX blockchain hypercloud, a smart contract has to be sandboxed
#       for isolation and security/resource control, in order to minimize
#       the impact of a potentially harmful smart contract affecting the
#       hosting node and/or other smart contracts on the same host.
#
#       This sandbox applies to the following types of PDX smart-contracts:
#       
#       1) OpenJDK-11 (java.base, java.logging, java.net.http) single-jar 
#
#	2) Statically linked, x64 Linux ELF formated executable program
#
# VERSION 0.1
